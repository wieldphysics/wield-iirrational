GQuEST-Design
====================================================

This package includes helper code and designs for the GQuEST experiment.

The codebase uses two major conventions: first is the wield-pytest method to run notebook-like cells. Second: Jupyter notebooks may also be included, but should follow certain conventions.

See :ref:`_gquest_install` for a guide on installing the library and how to run the tests.

The code uses python gwinc, wield.model, and Finesse and for its noise and interferometer models. Any other dependencies are welcome as well.
